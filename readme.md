# To work with the project you have to:

- Install nodejs and dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs ; or just download and run installer if you are a lucky windows/mac user ^_^

; Go to project's directory

$ npm install
$ npm gulp install -g ; Install Gulp (task runner) globally to be accessible in CLI
```

- Run Gulp task runner

```
$ gulp build; You can specify a specific task if you need, otherwise default task will be used
$ gulp server;
```

Now you can start editing sources and enjoy yourself.
